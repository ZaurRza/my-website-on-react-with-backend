# my-website-on-react-with-backend
My first try to make website with back with react. That's not bad, but i didn't complete backend logic, also i didn't make media (for mobile). This website is about exam training with variants and purchase.

Also I added file with some ideas, wich i didn't use but maybe in future i would.
